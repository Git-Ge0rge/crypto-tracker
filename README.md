### README Requirements

Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`.

The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

> Note: Do not include project planning (user stories, wireframes or ERDs) in the `README.md`.

Include the following sections within the **`README.md`**:

☐ **App Title:** Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.

☐ **Screenshot(s):** A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.

☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.

☐ **Getting Started**: That Includes:

- A link to the **deployed app** (Heroku)
- A link to the **Trello board** used for the project's planning that includes user stories, wireframes & an ERD.

☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

### Technical Requirements

☐ A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

☐ Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**:

- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node

☐ **Have a well-styled interactive front-end**.

☐ Communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

☐ Implement token-based **authentication**. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

☐ Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

☐ **Have a well-scoped feature-set**. Full-CRUD data operations are not required if one or more of the following are included:

- Consume data from a third-party API.
- Implement additional functionality if the user is an admin.
- Utilize multi-user, real-time communications (beware that this is difficult and time consuming - please seek instructor approval).
